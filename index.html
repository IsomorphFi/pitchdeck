  </div>
  
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>Traditional staking suffers from a lack of liquidity, limiting users' ability to access their staked assets. This hinders DeFi adoption and constrains capital efficiency.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Our Solution</h1>
    <p>Isomorph Staking Protocol provides a seamless liquid staking solution on Fuel Network, enabling users to stake ETH and receive isoTokens that can be used across DeFi applications.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Key Features</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate liquidity through isoTokens</li>
      <li>1:1 backing of all isoTokens with staked ETH</li>
      <li>Seamless integration with Fuel Network's ecosystem</li>
      <li>Transparent staking mechanism</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>Users stake their ETH with the Isomorph Staking Protocol and receive isoTokens in return. These isoTokens represent their staked ETH and can be freely used in DeFi applications while their original stake continues to earn rewards.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Market Opportunity</h1>
    <p>The global staking market is expected to grow from $14 billion in 2021 to $50 billion by 2026, driven by the increasing adoption of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and the demand for liquidity solutions.</p>
